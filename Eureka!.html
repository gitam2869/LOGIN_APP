                                <p class="mb-4" style="color:white;font-size: small;">Eureka! for us was more than just a business model competition, it was a virtual incubator. The shift from B-plan to B-model benefited us widely as the timeline of the competition kept us motivated to step beyond having just a 10-slide business deck to actually going out there, creating an MVP and testing the waters. Thanks to E-cell, IIT Bombay for organizing such a professional contest and here's to creating many more success stories!</p>
